        Hello, I'm William Moore, known to many as @williammooremusic on social
        media. With a following of over 400,000 across TikTok, Instagram and
        Facebook, I have had the privilege of sharing my unique blend of
        traditional sayings, nursery rhymes, and Lovecraftian twists with
        audiences around the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="font-subheading text-xs sm:text-sm">
        My first book, The Grimoire of Forgotten Fairytales, launched to
        wonderful support, raising more than double its crowdfunding target. Its
        sequel, The Tome of Terrible Truths, surpassed even that success,
        soaring to more than nine times its goal and finding readers across the
        globe.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="font-subheading text-xs sm:text-sm">
        These books also laid the foundations for the Forgotten Fairytales
        universe - a connected world of horror, folklore, and fantasy
        storytelling that has since grown to include The Grimoire Diaries, a
        top-charting audio drama exploring the story of the enigmatic writer and
        collector behind the books. What began on the page has become a
        multi-platform, multimedia experience that continues to expand. Now, I’m
        thrilled to invite you into the chilling final volume of the trilogy:
        The Book of Bitter Ends.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="font-subheading text-xs sm:text-sm">
        Although it is the third book in the series, each volume is a collection
        of poems, short stories, and illustrations that can be enjoyed entirely
        on its own. You don’t need to have read the previous books to step into
        this world - but if you have, you’ll discover threads and echoes that
        bind them all together.
